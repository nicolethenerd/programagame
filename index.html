    <h1>Program A Game</h1>

    <p>Program A Game is a FREE introductory programming curriculum targeted at students ages 10-14.  It makes use of Khan Academy's excellent interactive Processing.js environment to teach students important algebraic and geometric concepts.  Students learn about coordinate systems, variables, functions, and more as they proceed on their journey to create their very own video games.</p>

    <p>Program A Game was heavily inspired by Bootstrap, a slightly more rigorous curriculum also targeted at middle school students which uses Scheme.  </p>
